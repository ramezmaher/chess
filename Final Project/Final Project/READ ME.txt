6-Motion:
     **In order for a player to choose his/her next move
     you should select the square where the piece you wish to
     move is located by writing its coordinats.
     coordinats of any piece can be incicated by the number of its row
     indicated on the very left of the board
     and its column indicated by capital letters
     from A to H on the bottom
     **Afer choosing the piece you which to move
     you shall insert the location you which to send
     this piece to
     **Move selection happens by writing a single line
     containing both the location of the desired piece
     and the location
     where it will be sent , as follows
     A2A3 whill result for the black pawn
     to move a step forward
     **Note that if you insert an invalid move the game will not do it
     and will keep asking you for another move selection
7-Lost pieces:
     **Too bad,your opponent did a smart move and he took out your queen,
     if you're playing with the black pieces ,you can find all
     your lost pieces pn the left side of the board
     on the two columns named B and L which significates Black Losses
     while white's lost pieces are on the right side of the board
     on the two columns named W and L which significates White Losses   
8-promotion:
     **When you reach the last line of the opponent's side with a pawn
     you have the right to promote it to any advanced piece
     such as the queen or rook
     So when you are one square away from the last line
     your move selection sentence won't be same as usual
     you should insert the valid move as usual
     but also add at the end a single character representing
     the type of piece you wich to promote your pawn to.
     pieces symboles are indicated in the top of this file
     beware to choose the coresponding type
     so if you are the white you can't right 'Q'
     because that's the black's queen
     example:
     A2A1r--> this sentence means
     that you are willing to choose the pawn at A2
     and send it to A1 and promote it to a rook
     **Note that you can't reach the last line with a pawn
     and not promote it.
9-Check!:
     **When your opponent does a check on you
     that means that he is one move away from killing your king,
     you cannot move any pieces that doesn't protect your king
     from a certain death.
10-End Game:
     **the game can end in two situation
     a] If your opponent does a check on you
     and you have no piece to remove this check with
     nor can't move your king to avoid this check
     this will result for your loss
     by a Checkmate.
     b] If its not a Checkmate but you have no where to go to
     no valid moves ,this results a draw  and is called Stalemate
